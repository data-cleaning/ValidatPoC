The rule is that grandparents must be at least 28 years older than their grandchildren.

The [file](Rule_05.csv) contains columns

- id person id 
- age (in years)
- grandchild_of: id of person who is the grandparent

The following problems should be detected:

- The person with id=2 can not be the grandchild of the person with id=3
- The person with id=5 can not be the grandchild of the person with id=4

Furthermore, for the person with id=6, the age is unknown so no status can be derived with respect to this record.
