The evaluation of existing languages for specifying data validation rules is one of the main objectives of the ESSnet on Validation project (Validat â€“ Foundation). Specifically, two types of tasks are defined in work package 4, namely the conduction of a formal study (task 15), described in [study] and the implementation of a prototype, described in \textsc{this document}. Originally, two candidate languages were considered for evaluation: VALS, which had already been under development for some years under the auspices of Eurostat, and VTL, a more recent development from the SDMX community, of which Eurostat is a member. Given to circumstances not forseeable at the outset of the project, the development of VALS was ceased. This is described in more detail in the introduction to [study].

The objective of the prototype described in this document was to assess the practical usability of VTL when used for specifying and exchanging validation rules in the ESS. Given the current lack of editors and runtimes for VTL, it was decided to spin the prototype more into the direction of a practical approach to integrating VTL into existing data validation systems. Fortunately, two of the project partners, the Dutch CBS and the German FSO, have developed productive data validation systems -  \textit{Validate} and \textit{eSTATISTIK}, respectively - that both feature full-fledged data validation specification languages, but differ fundamentally in their technical layouts and integrations with end-users and production systems. Including both systems into the prototype suggested itself as it promised to increase the relevance of the findings considering the diversity of environments in which data validation is performed in the ESS.
