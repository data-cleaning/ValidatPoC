\title{Data and Rules}
\label{datarules}

The rule set for this proof of concept was chosen to on one hand reflect rules
that are used in practice and on the other hand cover a wide range of rule
types.  For this reason, two rules sets were combined. 

The first rule set was obtained by first classifying the rules obtained through
the ESS survey \citep{walsdorfer:2015}, and picking a rule from each formal
class defined in the handbook \citep{loo:2015c, zio:2015}. This formal
classification divides validation rules into ten disjunct classes,
which can be aggregated in five levels of complexity. 
The idea of this typology is that each data value
is identified by a set of four not completely independent keys that label:
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain: $U$,
\item the time of measurement $\tau$. This determines the population,
\item the selected statistical unit: $u$,
\item the variable that is measured: $X$.
\end{itemize}
Validation functions are labeled according to whether they are a function of a
single ($s$) or multiple $(m)$ instances of these keys. For example, the rule
$x > 0$ is labelled $ssss$ and the rule $x + y = z$ is labelled $sssm$  (since
it involves multiple variables. Since the keys are not completely independent
there are 10, not 16 independent categories.  As it turned out, nine of the ten
classes (and four of the five complexity levels) actually occur in rules
reported to the survey.

The second rule set was obtained by taking nine rules constructed for the study
of VTL by \cite{gelsema:2015}. These rules were constructed to test the limits
of what can be expressed by a language, and not necessarily for their
usefulness. The difference between the rules is mainly based on what operators
from first order logic are necessary to describe them.
